# MCPMint v0.1.0-alpha.2

## Highlights
- Finalizes the public alpha baseline around `mcpmint` naming and docs.
- Rewrites README for a clear mint-first onboarding flow.
- Removes internal planning/strategy markdown files from the public repo.
- Fixes CI quality-gate failures (`ruff`, `mypy`) without loosening checks.

## What Changed
- Documentation refresh:
  - New launch-ready `README.md` centered on the Magic Loop.
  - Clarified CLI map, security defaults, and governance workflow.
- Repository hygiene:
  - Untracked internal planning docs from GitHub while preserving local ignore behavior.
- CI stability fixes:
  - Resolved lint/import-order issues across approval/compile/decision modules.
  - Tightened typing in approval, canonicalization, and enforce pathways.
  - Added explicit mypy handling for optional dynamic MCP compatibility shim.

## Validation
- `ruff check mcpmint/ tests/` passes.
- `mypy mcpmint/ --ignore-missing-imports` passes.
- `pytest -q` passes (`266 passed`).
- `bash scripts/magic_moment_ci.sh` passes (governance harness).

## Upgrade Notes
- This release is intended as the clean public alpha baseline for `main`.
- No new breaking CLI changes vs alpha.1; focus is reliability and polish.
