# Glossary

Key terms used throughout Cask documentation.

## Core Concepts

**Cask**
Agent tool supply chain governance system. Captures real API traffic, compiles governed tool definitions, and serves them through MCP with lockfile-based approval and fail-closed enforcement.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
Standard protocol for AI agents to discover and use tools. Cask generates MCP-compatible tool definitions and serves them through an MCP server.

**Toolpack**
A compiled, versioned bundle of tool definitions, policy configuration, and metadata. Produced by `cask compile` or `cask mint`. Contains `toolpack.yaml`, `tools.json`, `policy.yaml`, and associated artifacts.

**Lockfile** (`caskmcp.lock.yaml`)
Signed record of approved tools, similar to `package-lock.json` or `Cargo.lock`. Each entry includes the tool name, schema digest, approval decision (allow/block), and an Ed25519 signature. No lockfile = no runtime.

**Tool Surface**
The set of API endpoints exposed as agent-callable tools. Changes to the tool surface are detected by `cask drift`.

**Governance Loop**
The full lifecycle: capture -> compile -> review -> approve -> serve -> verify. Each stage produces auditable artifacts.

## Capture

**HAR (HTTP Archive)**
Standard format for recorded HTTP traffic. Cask imports HAR files to discover API endpoints.

**OpenTelemetry (OTEL)**
Observability framework. Cask imports OTEL trace files as an alternative to HAR for endpoint discovery.

**OpenAPI Spec**
API specification format (YAML/JSON). Cask auto-detects and imports OpenAPI specs to generate tool definitions without live traffic.

**Endpoint**
A discovered API operation (method + path + host). Endpoints are the raw material that gets compiled into tools.

## Compilation

**Scope**
Permission boundary defining what a tool is allowed to do. Scopes classify endpoints as read, write, delete, etc. and assign risk tiers.

**Risk Tier**
Classification of an endpoint's risk level: `safe`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`. Determined by HTTP method, path keywords, auth sensitivity, and PII presence.

**Redaction**
Automatic removal of sensitive data (cookies, tokens, API keys, PII) from captured traffic and evidence bundles. Enabled by default.

**Redaction Profile**
Named configuration controlling what gets redacted. `default_safe` handles auth headers and tokens. `high_risk_pii` adds email, phone, and SSN detection.

## Approval

**Gate**
The approval workflow. `cask gate allow` approves tools. `cask gate block` blocks them. `cask gate check` validates all tools are approved (for CI).

**Signature**
Ed25519 digital signature on each lockfile entry. Proves who approved what and when. Verification fails if signatures don't match.

**Fail-Closed**
Default enforcement mode. If a tool is not explicitly approved in the lockfile, it cannot execute. No lockfile = no runtime. No exceptions.

## Runtime

**Drift**
Detected changes between the current API behavior and approved tool definitions. `cask drift` compares a baseline snapshot against the current state and reports additions, removals, and schema changes.

**Evidence Bundle**
Redacted artifacts from a verification or governance run, including SHA-256 digests for integrity. Used for audit trails and CI gates.

**DecisionTrace**
Audit log entry recording a governance decision (tool allowed, blocked, or drift detected) with timestamp, context, and rationale.

## Verification

**Contract**
Assertion-based verification rule. Contracts define expected behavior (e.g., "this tool must have a lockfile entry", "no critical-risk tools without explicit approval"). Run with `cask verify`.

**Replay Parity**
Property that two independent compilation runs from the same inputs produce identical artifacts and digests. Proved by `cask demo`.

## Workflow

**Tide**
Structured multi-step verification workflow engine integrated with Cask. Supports shell, HTTP, browser, and MCP step types. Each run produces an evidence bundle.
