| `github-api-scoped.yaml` | Curated spec (10 paths, ~21 operations) |
| `toolpack.yaml` | Toolpack manifest |
| `artifact/` | tools.json, policy.yaml, toolsets.yaml, baseline.json |
| `lockfile/` | Pending and approved lockfiles (21 tools, all approved) |
| `vars.env` | Reference parameters for manual runs; CI currently hardcodes paths |
| `DOGFOOD.md` | This file |

## Refreshing the spec

```bash
# Re-download from the pinned commit and re-curate
python3 dogfood/github/curate_spec.py --refresh
```

To update the pinned SHA, edit `PINNED_SHA` in `curate_spec.py` and re-run.

## CI usage

**PR gate:** `.github/workflows/gate-check.yaml` runs `cask diff` + `cask gate check`
against the committed toolpack. Triggers on PRs that modify `caskmcp/core/`,
`caskmcp/mcp/`, `caskmcp/cli/`, or `dogfood/github/`.

**Drift check:** Not wired for the GitHub dogfood. The spec is pinned at a static
commit SHA -- it can't drift. Drift detection requires a live API whose upstream
can change independently (e.g. a team's Jira or internal API). When we add a live
API dogfood target, the drift workflow template at
`.github/workflows/drift-check.yaml.example` can be instantiated with a fresh
capture step.
